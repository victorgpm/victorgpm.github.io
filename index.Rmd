## Liquidity

The liquidity is trending down due to global reflation.

```{r test1, echo=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
liquidity = read.csv("liquidity.csv")
myts2 <- ts(liquidity, start=c(1991, 1), end=c(2022, 11), frequency=12)
dygraph(myts2, main = "National Liquidity (M2 YoY)") %>%
dySeries(c("lwr", "fit", "upr"), label = "M2 YoY") %>%
dyRangeSelector()
```

## Inflation

Main driver for inflation in 2017 is increasing fuel prices, electricity tariff and commodity prices.


```{r test, echo=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
mydata = read.csv("inflasiYoY.csv")
myts<-ts(mydata, frequency=12, start=c(2003,1))
dygraph(myts, main="Inflation is Projected to Increase") %>%
  dyAxis("y", label="Inflation YoY") %>%
  dyRangeSelector()
```
